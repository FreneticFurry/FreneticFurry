im just that one person who likes making some random things every now & again :P

if you'd like to suggest things &/ or talk feel free to contact me! discord: freneticfurry
and if you'd like to support me on my random things then: https://www.patreon.com/FreneticFurry

everything on my github is designed to be Free To Use it isnt designed to be sold in any way shape or form! i do not want any of my creations sold even if it is a snippet found within something you've made around it, please respect that & hope you enjoy the free things i make! :D

please respect my wishes
1. do not take any of my code or works and train AI with it, this includes but is not limited to: asking ChatGPT "make this 'better' please!" i am very uncomfortable with people just taking what i make then giving it to LLM/ AI's like that.
2. do not attempt to sell any of my code or works, this includes but is not limited to making edits of my things with the intent to sell it - all of my stuff is meant to be free not sold.

thank you <3
